**Media Queries for Responsive Layouts**

My objective was to familiarize myself with techniques that creates a responsive design for its users. I focused on the most popular screen sizes 1280(desktop/laptop), 800(tablet), 320(mobile devices). I started by designing the main site for desktop users in my markup of the html/CSS files the site is incorperated by and adapting it to other screen sizes using @media queries. The site is constituted of five blocks of code (not including the normalize and fonts CSS files) that allow it to have different states of presentations depending on the devices screen resolution.

**Grid/Flexbox Combinations**

The profile.css block contains the most responsive coding as it has three different states. In the main site it contains a mix of grid and flexbox attributes.

**Different Visual Effects and Images**

There are serval selectors present in the CSS that are psuedo classes that changes the look of images and cursor for the users.
Below is are screenshots showing the images applied in the html:
